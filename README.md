# Text-Cell-Analyzer

A follow-up educational project to my bookbot Python program.

## Aim 

To build a Python script that analyzes the content of Excel spreadsheets and provide a statistical report of word and character usage found withing the cells.

This will also not only be for my own education and practice, but also to potentially benefit my team at work, who regularly deal with large volumes of Excel data. The goal is to help streamline the process of analyzing that data-especially when it comes to spotting patterns, keywords, and trends within the cells.

This tool will help me learn how to:
- Read and interpret Excel files using Pythin/
- Count and analyze specific patterns in cells (e.g. subsrtings like 'NTC' in things like 'NTC9084Samuel'
- Visualize simple in-program calculations on the data
- Write clear, well-commented, and maintable code (I hope)

## Learning Goals
- Strengthen my understanding of file parsing, pattern matching, and data analysis
- Learn to manipulate and analyze spreadsheet data using Python libraries (like pandas)
- Keep all logic in a single, understandable script file called 'main.py' (just like my bootbot project)
- Try to continue to practice writing clear good documentation, commenting my code and git/github Workflows
